Juno 6 Emulator (based on the Ultramaster sources)


This is the Ultramaster Juno 6 emulator project which has been more or less
stale from 2006 (as far as I can tell).

A slightly more up to date (2008?) version is available at:
http://juno6.gruftie.com/index2.html

Unfortunately the sources as is are fairly ancient and need to be brought up to
date.

I have taken the sources and got them to a stage where they are compiling on
a modern-ish system using GTK-1.2 which most distributions still include.

It currently compiles and runs but still needs much testing and down the track
I might try and get a better MIDI implementation going, using Jack.

I'll keep updating from here and hopefully bring this project back to life.
